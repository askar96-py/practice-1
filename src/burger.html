                    Hamburger, also called burger, is ground beef. The term is applied variously to a ground beef patty, sometimes called a Hamburg steak, Salisbury steak, or Vienna steak, a sandwich consisting of a ground beef patty served on a split bun with various sides, or the ground beef itself, which is used as a base in many sauces, casseroles, terrines and the like. Hamburger sandwiches are a fast food staple and are usually served with fries.
